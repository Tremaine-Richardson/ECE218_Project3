Description:
The system is a windshield wiper subsystem for an automobile. The system will take two inputs which are if the driver is seated and the ignition button is pressed and released, then the engine starts. To turn it off, the ignition button must be pressed and released. When the engine is on, the user is allowed to turn on the wipers and select what mode they desire. They can choose these outputs which are high mode, low mode, or intermittent which they can select three different delays. One delay is 3 seconds, one is 6 seconds, and the last one is 8 seconds. They can also turn off the wipers and depending on what mode the wipers are, a user display shows mode setting.
